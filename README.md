# NXG Keithley SMU 2450 2460 2461

This is the unofficial LabView NXG 5.0 library to control the Keithley SMU 2450 2460 2461, adapted and developed from an existing LabView 2015 version by Mart√≠ Gibert Roca.

To use it, one just needs to execute the installer inside the "Installer Files" folder and restart LabView NXG. The library will be on the "AddOns" tab. From there one can use the examples to see how it works.

NIVISA drivers are required for it to work. They can be installed within the NI Package Manager.

I also include the source files for developers to do whatever they please.

Cheers :)
